This is a lock free impl of a ring buffer which supports multiple producers and
multiple consumers.

lf_circular_buffer.h lf_circular_buffer.cpp contain the impl of the ring buffer.
lf_circular_buffer.t.cpp is a test program.
Each producer and consumers occupies a dedicated thread.

This impl works by allocating a dedicated data buffer for each consumer and producer
and one more data buffer in the queue.

When a producer cannot push, because the ring buffer is full an impl can do
at least one of the following

1. Overwrite some older data in the ring buffer.
2. Drop the new data.
3. Block the producer until there is room in the ring buffer.

This impl does a combination of the above.
In the description below the ring buffer is called the queue to avoid confusion
with data buffer.
Specifically, when a consumer needs to consume a data buffer, it pops the last
data buffer from the queue. The queue atomically exchanges the consumer's used
data buffer with the queue's own data buffer. If the queue's data buffer is
empty, the queue blocks the consumer in a tight loop until some producer swaps
a full data buffer with the queue'e empty data buffer.

A producer fills up its data buffer and pushes it to the queue.  The queue
atomically exchanges the new data buffer with its own data buffer.  If there is
data in the queue's data buffer, the queue blocks the producer until queue's
data buffer is empty. If the queue's buffer still contains data, even after
this producer managed to exchange its data buffer with the queue's data buffer,
this impl drops the old data buffer.
